# Spatial-Analysis-in-Basketball üèÄ
Project developed as part of my MSc thesis in Geoinformatics & Cartography at the University of Wroc≈Çaw.

The project explores the use of spatial analysis and cartographic visualization in basketball, using open shooting data.
It includes Python scripts for scraping and processing FIBA LiveStats data, creating spatial shot databases and computation of advanced shooting metrics (e.g. Spatial Scoring Effectiveness, Points Relative to League Average) and can be adapted for team- and player-level analysis.
